*reconhub*
==========

This packages installs and loads all stable RECON packages similiar to the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) package.

Work in progress.

Installing the package
----------------------

To install the current stable, CRAN version of the package, type:

``` r
install.packages("reconhub")
```

To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the development, *github* version of the package using:

devtools::install_github("reconhub/reconhub")
```

Note that this requires the package *devtools* installed.

library(reconhub)
```
