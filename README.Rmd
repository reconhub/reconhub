# *reconhub*

This packages installs and loads all stable RECON packages similiar to the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) package.

Work in progress.

## Installing the package

To install the current stable, CRAN version of the package, type:
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("reconhub")
```

To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the development, *github* version of the package using:
```{r install2, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("reconhub/reconhub")
```

Note that this requires the package *devtools* installed.


# What does it do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# attaches all stable recon packages
library(reconhub)
```
